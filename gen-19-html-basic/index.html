                        Google Earth came into existence in 2005. A year later,
                        it experienced a revolutionary tremor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Palestinian man from Jenin, Thameen Darby, created the
                        Nakba Layer, mapping Palestinian villages that were
                        destroyed or depopulated in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
                        The maps showed parts of Palestine that are not even
                        seen in maps created by Palestinian authorities,
                        geographer Linda Quiquivix, who researched the Nakba map
                        and maps of Palestine, told Al Jazeera.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Nakba map of 2006 sparked controversy and anger
                        among some Israelis, who reported it to their local
                        police for being an “assault on true geography”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what is true geography? Do the maps we see every day
                        accurately represent borders and spaces?
                    </p>
                    <h2>Do maps lie?</h2>
                    <p>
                        “Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it is essential,”
                        wrote cartographer Mark Monmoneir in his book How to Lie
                        with Maps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He showed that condensing complex, three-dimensional
                        spaces onto a two-dimensional sheet of paper is bound to
                        be reductive. Maps are made by people, historically
                        those with power. Hence, they are a projection of how
                        people see the world - projections that are full of
                        preconceived ideas and biases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, maps are also deliberately skewed to distort
                        people’s perceptions of spaces and issues, he argued. “A
                        good propagandist knows how to shape opinion by
                        manipulating maps,” wrote Monmoneir.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Propaganda maps were popular during and even before the
                        20th century when warring nations used cartography to
                        further their war-time agenda, painting the opposing
                        nations as negative caricatures.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Different symbols were used on maps: for example, the
                        octopus with its multiple tentacles was used to depict
                        the aggressor. While a British cartographer used the
                        octopus to depict Russia, a French cartographer depicted
                        Winston Churchill as the mollusc. Propaganda maps were
                        also popular during the Cold War.

                    <h2>The West’s map hegemony</h2>
                    <p>
                        A common template used for world maps today is called
                        the Mercator projection, created by European
                        cartographer Geert de Kremer in 1569. The projection has
                        been criticised for being widely misleading as it
                        significantly distorts proportions. While three Canadas
                        can fit inside Africa, Africa is significantly smaller
                        and less detailed than Canada on the map. Fourteen
                        Greenlands can squeeze into Africa — but on the Mercator
                        map, the Danish territory is shown almost as large as
                        Africa.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Alaska looks larger than Mexico, when in reality it is
                        smaller. Europe — not including Russia — seems to be
                        about the same size as South America. In reality, South
                        America is nearly twice as large. And Europe is at the
                        centre of the map, with the Asia-Pacific to the
                        periphery, when Asia is the globe's most populous
                        continent, the planet's largest land mass, and today,
                        the world's economic nerve centre.

                        In the 1800s, the Gall-Peters Projection was introduced,
                        subverting the Eurocentric proportions of the Mercator
                        Projection and sizing landmasses more accurately.
                        However, it was not until the 1970s that the Gall-Peters
                        projection was introduced to a wider audience. And most
                        educational institutions around the world still use the
                        Mercator Projection to teach geography in classrooms.

                        In May 2019, then-US President Donald Trump signed
                        “nice” on a map of Israel indicating that the occupied
                        Golan Heights belong to Israel, rather than Syrian
                        territory. The Golan Heights were occupied by Israel
                        during the 1967 Six-Day War and then effectively annexed
                        in 1981, a move that has not been recognised by the
                        international community.

                        In November of the same year, the Russian parliament's
                        lower house announced that Apple Maps would display
                        Crimea as part of Russia when viewed from Russia. Crimea
                        was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in March 2014, a step
                        that was criticised internationally. Initially, Apple
                        suggested showing Crimea as an undefined territory, but
                        it ended up complying with Russia, earning condemnation
                        from Ukrainians. Mashable reported in 2022 that Apple
                        started clearly marking Crimea as part of Ukraine, at
                        least outside of Russia.

                        Additionally, China uses maritime maps to claim all of
                        the South China Sea. Using a U-shaped line called the
                        nine-dash line , China's maps declare that the South
                        China Sea — a key maritime trade thoroughfare — belongs
                        entirely to China. This has been a bone of contention
                        between China and Southeast Asian neighbours, including
                        Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, which also claim
                        the waters nearest to their coasts.

                        An international tribunal ruled in 2016 that the map
                        does not provide China with legal grounds to claim the
                        sea, but this did not stop the nine-dash line from
                        appearing on a newly released Chinese national map in
                        2023.

                        Indian-controlled Kashmir, withdrawing its statehood and
                        carving it into two federally governed territories in

                        Islamabad unveiled a map that showed all of Kashmir —
                        including the part controlled by India — as belonging to

                        Palestinians have been using maps.

                        She started to also see that after the Oslo Accords in
                        1993 , a lot of the Palestinian leadership's energies
                        went into making maps that were parallel to a state of
                        Israel, leaning towards a “two-state” view of the land.
                        The leadership mapped only the Gaza Strip and the West
                        Bank, and not all of Palestine “where the refugees
                        [believe they] still have the right of return, and where
                        there's also Palestinian citizens of Israel”, she
                        explained. Israel has denied Palestinians who were
                        evicted from their land in 1948, and their descendants,
                        the right to return.

                        This, she said, has led to cartographic erasure of
                        Palestinians. On the other hand, Darby's Nakba map has
                        villages that Palestinian refugees in exile can use to
                        “show the world where their villages are that were
                        destroyed or occupied to create the State of Israel”.

                        The advent of the internet has equipped locals and
                        communities with platforms to share their own maps, said
                        Quiquivix.

                        “It's just so much harder for the dominant world to hide
                        its contradictions.”
